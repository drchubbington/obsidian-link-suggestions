When writing notes in Obsidian, you need to manually link your notes, making it easy to forget. With this plugin, you can auto-link any note with a single command.

The auto-linker looks for text in your note that matches the name of another note and links them. Note that this project is a work-in-progress. Notes that contain the name of another note will not link properly, and some notes will occasionally not autolink.

OBSIDIAN is a connective note-taking software. It is great for note-taking, planning, journaling, and much more.
